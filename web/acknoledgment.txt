This game was initated by Brian Stone, researcher in Dublin City University and Scuba Diver. It was written under the supervision of Brian Stone and thanks to the previous version of Povilas Auskalnis and Jerzy Baran by Vincent Bessouet, Cassien Ippolito, Tristan Le Nair and Florian Talour. This is a  game with purpose: your work and actions in the game will help a neural network to learn how to recognise sharks and will participe in making statistics. We hope you will have fun playing this game as much as we had making it.
